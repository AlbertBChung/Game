1. Accomplished This Week
   - worked on querying wikipedia (ended up changing our source)
   - found source for fake facts and for real facts
   - retrieve and parse facts (2 at a time) from mentalfloss.com

2. Challenges This Week
   - struggling with displaying facts on the HTML page
   - working with Twitter API
   
3. Goals for Next Week
   - put facts into HTML page
   - get tweets from @realfaketweets to use as fake facts
   - randomize which box the fake/real facts appear in (since we don't want 
   the true facts to always be in the same two boxes!)
